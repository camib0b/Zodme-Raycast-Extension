# Zodme

Zodme is a Raycast extension that converts a birth date into its zodiac sign and shows a short description of the sign’s archetype.

## Features
- Instant zodiac sign lookup from a date
- Clean detail view with a short description
- Copy the sign name or description to clipboard

## Usage
1. Open Raycast
2. Run **Zodme**
3. Type a date in the search bar

Date Examples:
- `today`
- `tomorrow`
- `yesterday`
- `March 21`
- `21 March`

## Notes
- The year is not important (only month/day are used).
- If a format isn’t recognized, try a month name (`March 21`) or numeric month/day (`3/21`).

## Development
